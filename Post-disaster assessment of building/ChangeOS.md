#### Overall impression
In this paper,they propose a deep object-based semantic change detection framework, called ChangeOS, for building damage
assessment. To seamlessly integrate OBIA and deep learning, they adopt a deep object localization network to
generate accurate building objects, in place of the superpixel segmentation commonly used in the conventional
OBIA framework. Furthermore, the deep object localization network and deep damage classification network are
integrated into a unified semantic change detection network for end-to-end building damage assessment. This
also provides deep object features that can supply an object prior to the deep damage classification network for
more consistent semantic feature representation.
