# [S2Looking: A Satellite Side-Looking Dataset for Building Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09244.pdf)

_Sep 2021_

#### Overall impression
This paper introduces S2Looking, a building change detection dataset that contains large-scale sidelooking satellite images captured at various off-nadir angles. The dataset consists of 5000 bitemporal image pairs of rural areas and more than 65,920 annotated instances of changes throughout the world. 
It expands upon existing datasets by providing: 1) larger viewing angles; 2) large illumination variances; and 3) the added complexity of rural images. 
The dataset is available at [S2looking Dataset](https://github.com/S2Looking/)
