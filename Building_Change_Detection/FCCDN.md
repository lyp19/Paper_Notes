# [FCCDN: Feature Constraint Network for VHR Image Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10860.pdf)

_Sep 2021_

#### Overall impression
In this work, a feature constraint change detection network (FCCDN) is proposed. 
They constrain features both on bi-temporal feature extraction and feature fusion.
More specifically, they propose a dual encoder-decoder network backbone for the change detection task. 
At the center of the backbone, they design a non-local feature pyramid network to extract and fuse multi-scale features. 
To fuse bi-temporal features in a robust way, they build a dense connection-based feature fusion module. 
Moreover, a self-supervised learning-based strategy is proposed to constrain feature learning.
Based on FCCDN, they achieve state-of-the-art performance on two building change detection datasets (LEVIR-CD and WHU). 
Moreover, for the first time, achieve the acquire of accurate bi-temporal semantic segmentation results without using semantic segmentation labels. It is vital for the application of change detection because it saves the cost of labeling
