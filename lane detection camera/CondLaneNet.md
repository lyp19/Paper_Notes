_May 2021_

#### Overall impression
In this work,they propose CondLaneNet,a novel top-to-down lane detection framework that detects the lane instances first and then dynamically predicts the line shape for each instance.AInming to solve lane instance-level discrimination problem,they introduce a conditional lane detection strategy based on convolution and row-wise formulation.Further,they deisign the Recurrent Instance Module(RIM) to overcome the problem of detecting lane lines with complex topologies.

#### Key ideas
- Instance Detection
  They detect the lane instacne by detecting the proposal point located at the start point of the line.
